# FaceMap Geometry Utils

## Data Template

* Romain's (no template, requires registration)
* Duthie Hill
* coretech_v2 (FaceDome, from Peihong)

## Localization

UV, 2 options: 
* projection based, 
* provided/optimized and hand tuned.
QuadMesh:
Not easy

## Distortions:
### Perlin Noise 

* 3D as in Geo_metric (need more vertices) https://pvigier.github.io/2018/11/02/3d-perlin-noise-numpy.html
* 2D as displacement map or normal map (works with high frequency)


### Simplification (planarization)


### Smoothing (feature removal)
